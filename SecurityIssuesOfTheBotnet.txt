Potential security issues with the botnet.

-	Man in the middle attacks, since messages are not encrypted while being sent anyone can spoof the message.

-	Since I am not authenticating me to my server connection malicious users can impersonate a client and pretend to be another group for example, gaining axes to the network.

-	No data integrity check in transmission since there is no signature being validated on the sender and receiver end so that messages can be altered on the way.

-	DoS Attacks, my server does not incorporate proper handling of being overwhelmed by requests from other servers or clients which can lead to server meltdown.

-	Since there is no segmentation except for the segmentation of the TAâ€™s server this network can be classified as a flat network architecture, meaning that if there is a breach of one node, it endangers the entire network.

Security implications that could improve the network:

-	Authentication of clients and servers.

-	Using TLS or SSL to encrypt data in transit.

-	Employing a VPN channels for security in anonymit
